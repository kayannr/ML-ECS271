# ECS271 - Machine Learning & Discovery

- HW1: kNN implementation from scratch (MNIST data)
  -   Object-oriented programming 

- HW2: Single-layer fully connected neural network model for MNIST image classification trained using activation functions like ReLU and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with mini-batch from scratch 

- HW3: Training Deep Network with fully connected single layer and multiple fully connected layers using activation functions like ReLU using PyTorch ([CIFAR10 data](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html))
